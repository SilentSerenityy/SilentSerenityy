Hello everyone! My name is **Shadi**, and I am just a developer that likes to have fun with many things in life, including, of course, coding!
Come and check it out!
A few of my big projects involve *Cassandra#9492*, the fun bot for Discord, and my website, *https://shadidev.tk*

These number is the amount of clicks on my profile, and it counts reloading, clicking on repositories, tabs, anything that concerns my profile.

I am also very good very confidently and expressively doing karaoke at my computer when no one else is around, but going into that would be a bit of a chore.
