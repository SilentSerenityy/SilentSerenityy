### 👋 Hello everyone! My name is **Shadi**, and I am just a developer that likes to have fun with many things in life, including, of course, coding!
### Come and check it out! My official website is **https://shadidev.tk/**!! 🥳

#### If you ever want to describe me in a few words...
> 🎈 Loves to have fun, yes! - coding, in my opinion, is all about the fun (and trial and error) that you incur along the way.
> 
> 🧪 Experimentalist, I like trying out new things *sometimes* - it's interesting seeing the cool stuff out there.
> 
> ✨ Razzle-dazzler, desire to add a nice flair to everything I do - I am really into styling and making things looks nice.
> 
> 🧨 Limit pusher, nothing more fun than testing the boundaries of some code! - change up the code, put cool stuff in it.

#### And also a few more side notes...
> 🍩 I like treats because they are yum yum! - Starbucks Frappucinno for the win.
> 
> 🥰 I'm a solo coder, but I love making friends - believe me, I really do like making a nice friend.
> 
> 💻 I'm the lead developer of the verified Discord bot Cassandra#9492 - ask me about it!

#### My social medias...
> 💬 Discord! Let's be friends! **Shadi#9492** - I like being social, so add me! I am quite the active one.
> 
> 💻 Repl.it! **SilentSerenity** - here you can find even more of my code, some scrap code, other interesting things.
> 
> 🎥 YouTube! **SilentSerenity** - sometimes and not very often I post quite random things, or scrap gaming clips.

#### Some good widgets!
