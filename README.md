### 👋 Hello everyone! My name is **Shadi**, and I am just a developer that likes to have fun with many things in life, including, of course, coding!
### Come and check it out! My official website is **https://shadidev.tk** !! 🥳

#### If you ever want to describe me in a few words...
> 🎈 Loves to have fun, yes! - coding, in my opinion, is all about the fun (and trial and error) that you incur along the way
> 
> 🧪 Experimentalist, I like trying out new things *sometimes* - if I'm really bored or really engaged I'll have a go at something nice and new
> 
> ✨ Razzle-dazzler, desire to add a nice flair to everything I do - I am really into styling and making things looks nice
> 
> 🧨 Limit pusher, nothing more fun than testing the boundaries of some code! - change up the code, put cool stuff in it, how does it hold?

#### And also a few more side notes...
> 🍩 I like treats because they are yum yum! - Starbucks Frappucinno for the winn
> 
> 🥰 I'm a solo coder, but I love making friends - believe me, I really do like making a nice friend 

#### My social medias...
